## 📌 Purpose
This project explores heart disease data by analyzing demographic and clinical variables to understand how age, gender, blood pressure and other medical indicators relate to heart disease presence.  
The dashboard was created to practice data visualization, pivot analysis and risk scoring using **Google Sheets**.

---

## 🧩 Dataset Information
- **Source:** Kaggle — Heart Disease Prediction Dataset
- **Rows:** 271 patients
- **Columns:** 16 medical attributes
- **Key Fields:**
  - Age
  - Sex
  - BP
  - Cholesterol
  - Max HR
  - Exercise Angina
  - ST Depression
  - Chest Pain Type
  - Heart Disease (Presence / Absence)

---

## 📊 Dashboard Features
Dashboard includes:

✔ Slicers (Sex, Age Group, Heart Disease)  
✔ KPI indicators  
✔ Pivot charts  
✔ Distribution visuals  
✔ Risk Index calculation  

---

## 🔍 Key Insights (Summary)
- Heart disease occurs more frequently in **middle-aged groups**
- Younger patients tend to perform better on exercise tests
- Blood pressure levels increase with age
- Risk factors tend to compound as age increases
- Calculated **Risk Index** shows a mean value of **5.50**

---

## 🧮 Risk Index Formula (Custom Metric)

For each patient:

``= ( MaxHR / Age ) * ( Cholesterol / BP )``

---

## 🧰 Tools & Methods Used
- **Google Sheets**
- Pivot Tables
- Pivot Charts
- Slicers
- Custom Formula Metrics
- Segmentation
